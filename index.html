That's all for now; I will post updates as needed while also simultaneously transforming this website into a live blog. Thank you for stopping by.</p>

                <article id="Grind">
                    <h2 class="major">Grind</h2> 
                    <span class="image main"><img src="images/Space/Space04.jpg" alt=""/></span>
                    <p>While trying to come up with an organized list of skills and projects I've built over time, I also came to a funny realization that a good chunk of the things that I've learned and brought to life was due to a short-lived infatuation with the subject and not due to my actual interest in them.</p>
                    <h5>Here's what you should know about me:</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I'm working on security certifications like <a href="https://elearnsecurity.com/product/ejpt-certification/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eJPT</a> from INE (in progress) and <a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OSCP</a> from Offensive security, I would recommend eJPT to anyone getting into cybersecurity since it covers most of the basic topics that will build your foundation so you can progress to further certifications, and also it's more of a hands-on material so you'll gain tons of practical knowledge as well.
                        </li>
                        <li>Extensive research experience in malware and ransomware attacks to analyze the various attack vectors used in them, a great source I found online is <a href="https://thedfirreport.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">thedfirreport</a>, do check it out.
                        </li>
                        <li>Also a <a href="https://mern.js.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MERN stack</a> developer, I had to force myself to learn this stack of applications to develop the projects that I have in mind, which consists of 'BlindMatch' it's a social network product I'll roll out soon, and 'It's Okay to Get Help' both these projects excite me to learn more and create better. I can't wait to build and release these projects as they are still in the development stage.
                        </li>
                    </ul> 
                </article> 
                <article id="Learn"> 
                    <h2 class="major">Learn</h2> 
                    <span class="image main"><img src="images/Space/Space48.jpg" alt=""/></span> 
                    <p>I'm surprised I even made a "Learn" section on this website, well now that it's here, I might as well throw some wisdom and knowledge, so here's what I'll suggest since I used them myself to hone my skillset in the past couple of years. For the ones that don't know, I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast, and this entire section is going to document the things I've learned over time in an organized structure, since I didn't follow a structured path and was confused myself, I'd like to guide others to a treasure I didn't possess.</p>
                    <h3>Fundamentals:</h3> 
                    <p>Learning a specific skill has many approaches to it, there is no best way to do it, try not to get caught up trying to be perfect while learning. Feel free to make mistakes, but when you do, you must learn to get back up quickly and learn what caused it, so you don't do it twice.</p>
                    <p>Firstly, to learn any subject or topic, it's always good to do it in a proper methodology, be it your own or any proven method you find online.</p>
                    <p>Lookup <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l4w7uHdNaQ&ab_channel=BetterThanYesterday" target="_blank">The Pomodoro Technique</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrNqSLPaZLc&ab_channel=ScottYoung" target="_blank">The Feynman Technique</a>. There are a lot more techniques and methods to pick, choose what works for you, and customize if needed. </p>
                    <p>Secondly, be consistent. It takes time to be good at any skill you are passionate about; contrary to the popular 10,000-hour rule, you can NOT become a grandmaster in a discipline if you spend 10,000 hours just doing it with no quantifiable goals. Instead, you will have to spend 10,000 hours working like you desire to be a grandmaster in the discipline. There is a big difference.</p>
                    <h3>Programming:</h3> 
                    <p>Staring off with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOjov-2OZ0E" target="_blank">programming</a>, of course, everyone I see that wants to get into programming starts only with either <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hly31xKli0" target="_blank">DSA</a> or a programing language by watching some tutorials online and feeling great about it, and to me, that's perplexing. The best way to learn to program is to learn DSA and a programming language simultaneously while also building projects with it, so you know how to put things together. Start learning a language like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87SH2Cn0s9A" target="_blank">C</a> if you're patient, if not, then learn something with a simpler syntax like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS4aFq5-91M" target="_blank">JavaScript</a> while learning DSA on the side. <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/assembly_programming/assembly_introduction.htm" target="_blank">Assembly language</a> will be a great addition to your toolbox since you will be able to directly manipulate data at the computer architectural level, which can be useful in some specific use cases like exploit development or even while doing reverse engineering sometimes. (I've provided the links if anyone wants it.)</p>
                    <p>A bonus skill is to learn the right words so you know what to Google when you're facing an issue. Googling is a whole new skill by itself, and while being a self-learner, it's one of the most important things you'll have to know. I learned this the hard way. Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEBkvm0-rg0" target="_blank">this</a> video, I like how comprehensive it is.</p>
                    <h3>Linux/UNIX:</h3>
                    <p>Once you're comfortable with code, get your feet wet with any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like" target="_blank">UNIX-Like Operating System</a> because most of the web servers online use Linux as the Operating System, understand how it works, and familiarize yourself with some basic underlying functions like memory allocation, and others (These will be helpful later on while developing exploits). If I'm honest it's just that it's a whole lot better than any other Operating systems I've come across, especially <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/" target="_blank">Arch Linux</a>, here's a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/top/?t=all" target="_blank">treat</a>. If you're all soaked up with frustration right at the start, congratulations, you're doing it right.</p>
                    <h3>Networking:</h3>
                    <p>The next step is to start learning networking, take it really slow. Understanding the basics will lay the foundation for your future endeavors (if any). Start with the basic IP/TCP model and move on from there to learn more and more about other Internet Protocols, understanding various concepts like routers, cryptography, and many more will make you feel more comfortable while moving forward. Learn what the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TOR</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(network)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">network</a> is, what <a href="https://geti2p.net/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I2P</a> is, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOCKS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SOCKS5</a>, and a lot of other anonymizing protocols which you can use to just stay safe while you're "browsing" the web.</p>
                    <p>While learning networking, an issue I faced was that I forgot a lot of things in just a week or so after learning, and the solution to that is to learn through tiny bits of information, and review them later on repeatedly, for which you will have to maintain good notes. I used <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Notepad++</a> at the start to maintain the notes I prepared, but later on, I came across <a href="https://www.notion.so/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Notion</a>, and trust me it's a student's wet dream.</p>
                    <p>A tip to learn networking at a higher and deeper level is to learn socket programming in C because you will explicitly be able to see what's going on under the hood, and of course, practice and patience will be the essence to success. </p><p>I will leave some links to learn networking, I've tasted them all partly, and up to what I've ingested, it's safe to say that you'll learn something useful.</p>

                    <h3>Hacking, finally:</h3>
                    <p>When we're talking about hacking, people will likely have a frown on their faces due to the general stigma around it. The actual meaning of the term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hacker</a> is a person with a deep understanding of a subject and solves problems creatively building a new "hack"; this definition is straight from the halls of MIT.</p>
                    <p>Developing thorough knowledge in a subject takes time and a good deal of conscientiousness. When all you're doing is reading and you're surprised that nothing is improving, I'm fighting the urge to talk about how the self-help industry works now for the same reason, but let's save that for another day, understand that when you take in information, it's most likely unorganized; for it to settle into an organized structure, you'll have to apply what you've just learned. It could be taking tests, developing projects, or doing anything that forces you to review your mind and apply what you already know. </p>
                    <p>To be continued...</p>
                    <p>This section is under constant development, I will make it more organized and easily accessible soon. Till then, have a great one.</p>

                    <h2>What exactly is Root?</h2> 
                    <p>Root's concept is a business model for collaborating with other businesses that are still in the "idea stage" and lack the resources to progress forward. That is, being unable to form a team and lacking a defined aim as one approaches the starting point.</p>
                    <p>While reading through a slew of case studies of new startups, I saw an anomaly of why startups fail miserably: they either have a great concept but a terrible execution, or they give birth to a product that is out of date with the times. Consider what I just said: there have been a number of "startups" that appear so promising with their promises but would make a lot more sense if they were started a decade or two ago, and other concepts are so far ahead of the curve that they'd be better off being founded a decade or two later.</p>
                    <p>At Root, we thoroughly discuss the founders' vision of how they want to see themselves in the near and distant future, as well as a variety of other aspects of the company, in order to maximize the chances of the soon-to-be-born startup clipping onto a successful track, while also actively providing architectural, legal, and a variety of other things that should be taken care of in a startup.</p>
                    <h2>What do we get out of all this?</h2>
                    <p>We will be making money for a limited time from the company we're working with for a percentage share of its profits or a one-time equity settlement which can be negotiated once the prior discussion is done.</p>
                    <p>That's all for now. Expect a rollout anytime soon.</p><p>If you have an idea and would like to get in touch with us, go to the <a href="#contact">contact page</a> and shoot me a mail, I will get back to you with the team for further discussions.</p>
